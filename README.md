     dev-dependency in simple word, we'll use dev-dependency packages through the development process & It will not go to production.

```js
// So how to install any npm package as devDependency? & it's(devDependency) look like into package.json?

// install any packages as devDependency by simply adding a -D flag before the package name. -D flag means devDependency. Or you can install by adding --save-dev. Both of them are work fine

 ðŸ‘‰ npm i -D <package_name> // Or
 ðŸ‘‰ npm i --save-dev <package_name>


"devDependencies": {    // you will see an property inside package.json like this
    "nodemon": "^3.0.2"
  }

```
